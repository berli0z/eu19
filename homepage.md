# European Election 2019
# expose tracking and algorithm influence

bTREX is currently engaging in a pan-European, collaborative initative to observe narratives around the 2019 EU electoral campaigns and foster a deeper understanding of data exploitation models and algorithms used by social media platforms such as Facebook.

Until the end of May, fbTREX will offer services and tools necessary for this research, and will report on our findings. Our primary goal is to empower everyday users—not only technological and political researchers—to engage with and analyse news feed content curated by the Facebook algorithm.

You can learn more about the work of fbTREX in our [previous reports](...), [peer-reviewed publications](...), as well as in this [short introduction](...).

## Social scientists
It can be a struggle to study personalisation algorithms when you are confronted with technical complexities and platform secrecy. Our goal is to assist researchers analysing the social impact of personalisation algorithms. Check out our pages on [organising algorithm tests](...), and [comparing results among peers](...)

## Every Facebook user
Users represent a unique point of observation on the network. As our community becomes more diverse, we can collect more complete evidence of deceptive advertising, misleading communication, and abuse of influence. And as our community's curiosity grows, we can respond with a greater variety of usage. To contribute, install the extension.

## Whoever knows how to transform data
We follow an open data strategyâ€“our goal is to protect users while enabling analysis of social phenomena. If you are a dataviz developer, data scientist or data analyst, we'd love to collaborate with you!

## Political candidates and advertisers
If you have a sponsored Facebook presence, you might believe your communications are _disintermediated_, but they are not. We want to help you better understand how the algorithm treats your content. Reach out to us!

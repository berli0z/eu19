# fbTREX goals and ethos

In July 2018, we received confirmation from the [European Research Council](https://erc.europa.eu/news/erc-proof-concept-grant-examples-research-projects-2-round) that our 12 month development plan has been funded as a joint project with the University of Amsterdam. We will pursue partnerships and additional funds complementary with this project plan.

fbTREX intends to achieve the following goals in collaboration with partners who share the values, priorities, and ethics described below.

## Short-term goals

Here are some of our specific goals for the coming months.

1. To enlarge and diversify our community. We plan to do this by offering users more features:
	* To address misinformation issues for social media users by improving our ability to visualise the information diet of users, as well making our UX more accessible to a broader audience.
	* To focus on additional political contexts affected by content moderation and algorithm filtering; not just elections, but also conflict areas and other politically-charged events.
	* To develop awareness of the impacts of personalisation algorithms.

2. To affirm fbTREX as a valid forensic evidence collector by:
	* Identifying target users subject to particular rights.
	* Using evidence collected to criticise Facebook’s content moderation and raise questions about the news feed algorithm.
	* Contributing to the publication of more peer-reviewed studies and reports utilising our datasets.

3. To educate various stakeholders on ethical data usage, including:
	* By collaborating with additional research groups and partners.
	* By offering a clear and transparent opt-in procedure for our data processing.
	* By fortifying our role as technical supporters for politically-motivated activism globally.

## Long-term goals

Throughout 2019, we intend to make considerable progress toward our vision for fbTREX. We look forward to the following advancements:

1. Providing our community greater control over visualisations of their information diets.
	* Enabling users to experiment with, customise, and share visualisations to better reflect their individual values, priorities, and perspectives.
	* Enabling users to customise their algorithm, representing a major step toward algorithmic diversity.

2. Enabling our community to compare their news feeds with others, based on mutual agreement. We hope to involve a diverse community to compare feeds globally, in order to observe and verify whether fbTREX tools can be used to address misinformation and foster greater understanding of each other’s viewpoints.

3. Providing third-party researchers access to our anonymised datasets, to contextualise their findings, combine this with additional data, and complement it with social science methodologies to arrive at more rigorous conclusions in their research. We hope that through this process we can contribute to ethical data use models by:
	* Protecting user data by sharing it only with networks and researchers with whom we have built trusted relationships.
	* Continuing to develop a framework for ethical data reuse. We not only hope to promote literacy on algorithm transparency and accountability, but also to set an example for the potential of collecting datasets in the public interest in a manner which allows us to understand social phenomena while protecting individuals.

## Ethos

fbTREX is a free software project designed to promote accountability for personalisation algorithms, as well as understanding and awareness their effects. We aim to address Facebook’s closed model as a decentralized community. As we exist in the public interest, we do not sell our data.

Because our assets are unique, fbTREX should be seen as an infrastructure to facilitate analysis of Facebook data, rather than a specific product built on top of scraped data. fbTREX aims to enable anyone aligned with our mission to reuse the data we have gathered through collective observation.

Diversity ensures broad observation of social media and validity in testing. Algorithms are affecting all kinds of people globally, with different languages, cultures, and politics. It’s important to understand how algorithms affect everyone who makes up the global community of social network users.

We want to develop a reproducible method to measure the diversity of political debates as observed, and value our growth in accordance with this metric; diversity is a higher priority for fbTREX than raw numbers of users.

**Problem**
* Our information diet is increasingly defined by personalization algorithms like FB’s (this can be much catchier, work it out)
	* We don’t know how and can’t effectively control what content FB decides to show or hide from our news feeds (can you relate this to a scenario in which food is not labeled without being too kitschy?)
	* 500 contacts, only seeing content of the same 30 friends
		* You should know why, as this is effectively a distortion of reality
* Algorithms are influencing our priorities, lifestyles, moods, opinions
	* Algorithmic hegemony: FB has delegated this power to itself in an opaque manner regarding the functioning and objectives of its algorithms
		* Algorithmic curation is persistent and appears to rely on seemingly arbitrary factors that users do not control or inform
		* We must instead be able to consciously build our own algorithms
		* Not everyone has the knowledge and skills to design their own
* Quitting FB is not an option
	* Social isolation

**Vision**
* To understand how our individual social media experiences present to us different realities
	* To help us to better understand how technology works and impacts our information diets and perceptions of reality
		* Who is informing us? What topics?
	* To empower ourselves against the opaqueness of automated decision making in our lives
	* This issue has surfaced due to concerns and scandals around major events like elections, but it is a daily problem
* To visualize in an accessible manner our information diets
	* To individually audit how FB is shaping our informative experiences (including by post type, source, keywords, sentiment)
	* To be able to experiment with parameters
* To be able to compare our information diets
	* Based on mutual agreement
	* To compare diverse groups of users globally
* To open up the FB blackbox and shine a light inside
* To create persistent records of our own timelines
* Algorithmic diversity: To foster a community where algorithms can be shared, compared, improved, remixed, critiqued by autonomous and informed individuals deciding what is most appropriate for them at a given time
	* To raise awareness around the concept of algorithmic diversity and our right to pick our own algorithms
	* To see if we can develop better algorithms than FB
	* To take back control over our own decision-making, as no one knows what matters to us more than we do
	* To experiment with new ideas about how we can co-exist with algorithms by taking ownership over them and exploring potential alternatives for social interaction and information sharing
		* Contrary to FB’s practices, we can create scenarios in which algorithms might behave ethically and transparently to protect our personal data and prioritize our own needs

**Solution**
* Browser extension: a tool which makes a copy of your timeline and (later) compares it with people you know
	* Brief description
* Website: a webapp which aggregates that data and presents it in a straightforward, visual manner
	* Enables you to rewind your timeline, to see the sources and content of your information diet
		* To see personal trends, which friends influence you, to which networks you belong
	* Helps you assess how you are using the platform, whether the interaction is productive and the amount of time you spend with FB

**CTA**: Donate your digital body! (perhaps clarify by mentioning  and developing this concept in the text)
* Since quitting FB is not an option, instead, pop your information/filter bubble
* Join our digital evidence-gathering community to participate in our efforts to better understand what the FB algorithm feeds us
	* The more our community grows, the better we will understand the differences between our bubbles, and the different realities they create for us
	* Together we can understand how different information environments affect us, in particular around important events like elections

**Privacy**
* We will collect only the information that FB provides to you in your news feed
* We will collect only posts marked as public
	* We will never collect posts marked for friends only, or custom audiences
* You have full control over your data
	* May delete at any time
* No one will have access to your data unless you expressly grant them access. You will have to opt-in to any third-party, including research groups, that you may want to interact with.
* All research conducted must strictly aim at understanding social phenomena and algorithmic influence, you will never be the subject or object of any study
* This is not SOCMINT
	* Link and/or explanation
	* Briefly explain our criticisms of SOCMINT

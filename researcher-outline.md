* Link/refer to “Results”
* Link/refer to “Stats”
* Do we want to suggest use cases, as below?
* report + presentation of WS DMI?

**Problem**

* Algorithmic hegemony: proprietization of info; FB sees society better than it can see itself
	* FB’s outsized influence over public discourse
	* FB’s dominance over political opinion and news sharing, particularly during elections
	* FB algorithm feeds info based on orientation and reinforces confirmation bias
* Feed personalization has impact on lifestyle, mood, opinion of millions
* Opacity
* Lack of regulation; lack of even understanding of the algorithm necessary to regulate it
* Example: Like buying a newspaper yet only receiving the articles the newsstand thinks will interest you
	* Diminishing shared body of news and understanding of reality, as your neighbors receive an entirely different paper
* Additional problems should be identified by researchers
	* e.g. targeted pol ads, misinformation, polarization/extremization, echo chambers, content moderation, algorithmic censorship (e.g. selective appearance of political uprisings), distorted/different perceptions of reality, intermediation of public sphere, post competition/ordering/ranking, profiling

**Vision**

* To promote algorithmic diversity
* To be a neutral actor, providing research-quality data (usable evidence)
* Collaborative research/collective approaches
* To prioritize and encourage interdisciplinary approaches
	* Among analysts, activists, advocates, journalists
* To foster:
	* Third-party research into the FB algorithm
		* FB’s in-house research itself is black boxed by NDAs
	* Critiques of FB algorithm, in particular in the hopes that it could be modified to minimize harmful social effects
	* A global and diverse community to critique the algorithm from different points of view
		* Priorities of people/cultures outside Palo Alto*
		* Studies so far have focused mostly on US/EU
	* Visibility and a better understanding of “far away” perspectives and concerns
		* What does a refugee see? Can we use someone else’s filter bubble to understand their world, perspective, feelings?
	* Efforts to address algorithmic discrimination
	* A better understanding of whether the issues that arise with algorithmic personalization can be adequately addressed by regulatory authorities
	* Measurements, models, and analyses of biases caused by FB algorithm
	* A better understanding of the impact of targeted advertising on our perception and choices
* To promote informed decision-making
* To introduce more transparency and accountability to the FB algorithm
* To clarify how the FB business model is leading to the distortion of our time (chronological?), expectations and perceptions of reality
* To promote the idea that platforms must be fully transparent in their curation practices
* To encourage FB to live up to their supposed mission of “giving people the power to build community and bring the world closer together” 
* To free data back to society

**Solution**
* 14 studies so far on elections or referendums (countries in notes)
* To provide robust infrastructure to support emergent research and experimentation
* To discover diverse ways of reusing data and findings
* To develop alternative perspectives on how social networks should work, and how data should be used
* To introduce scientific accuracy to ongoing observations of problems presented by the FB algorithm
* To collect time-sensitive, filtered content for data analysts to research for patterns that help us understand how FB functions
* Our mandate is not to deliver a single feature; we want to engage communities to devise solutions together

**CTA** (not too great yet, will work this out better in the flow of writing)
* Our collected data is useful to understanding Facebook only if it is utilized for research
* Help us to address the multifaceted issues presented by algorithmic hegemony
	* Potential use cases: NGOs and internet freedom activists who wish to enhance the impact of their activities; GDPR compliance monitoring; strategic litigation; communication/awareness campaigns about SM monopolies and exploitation of profiling; journalists and researchers who want to improve their understanding of the social dynamics developing outside their immediate network of knowledge (filter bubble) 

**Technology/Methodology**
* Technology:
	* Open technology solutions which enable analysis of SM power dynamics
		* Copy user timeline
			* Explain briefly how this is done
	* Output: Subdomain
		* Dedicated site, advocacy, reference person
* Methodology: (need further clarification on what should be laid out here)
	* Reproducible
	* Reuse data to perform analytics, comparisons, statistics
	* Publicly and transparently audit the OSN ecosystem
	* Black box analysis

**Limitations**
* Full dataset access is limited to researchers analyzing collective phenomena in the public interest
	* Only timelines
	* Only public posts
	* User has full control over data
	* Third-party access granted by each user in each use case
	* Analysis must aim at understanding social phenomena, not individuals

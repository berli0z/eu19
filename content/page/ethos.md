In July 2018, we received confirmation from the [European Research Council](https://erc.europa.eu/news/erc-proof-concept-grant-examples-research-projects-2-round) that our 12 month development plan has been funded as a joint project with the University of Amsterdam. We will pursue partnerships and additional funds complementary with this project plan.

fbTREX is a free software project designed to promote accountability for personalisation algorithms, and for increasing understanding and awareness of their effects. We aim to address Facebook’s closed model as a decentralized community. As we exist in the public interest, we do not sell our data.

Because our assets are unique, fbTREX should be seen as an infrastructure to facilitate analysis of Facebook data, rather than a specific product built on top of scraped data. fbTREX aims to enable anyone aligned with our mission to reuse the data we have gathered through collective observation.

Diversity ensures broad observation of social media and validity in testing. Algorithms affect all kinds of people globally, with different languages, cultures, and politics. It’s important to understand how algorithms affect everyone who makes up the global community of social network users.

We want to develop a reproducible method to measure the diversity of political debates, and value our growth in accordance with this metric; diversity is a higher priority for fbTREX than raw numbers of users.

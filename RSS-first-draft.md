fbTREX RSS feed is rolling out so that citizens can act ahead of the 2019 European elections to get a glimpse into how the Facebook algorithm polarises us and foster a more complete information diet based on a collective feed of information on various subjects.
Facebook does not enable us to understand or control how our news feed content—our information diet—is selected. Facebook’s opaque algorithm may even provide two different users seeking the same information completely different lenses through which to perceive of the subject, as Eli Pariser discovered.1 The influence that Facebook’s algorithm exercises over our worldviews reinforces political polarisation and restricts users’ common access to a complete spectrum of knowledge.

To understand the complex, contemporary political debate, we need tools to help us pop our filter bubbles. fbTREX RSS feed allows us to analyse, experiment with, and educate ourselves about the information in each of our news feeds, in order to make more informed decisions based on a broader, collective perspective of facts and events.

In cooperation with journalists, researchers and citizens, our experiences with fbTREX can provide useful insights for policymakers.

fbTREX RSS feed presents a disintermediated, machine-readable data feed. Queries retrieve posts from all contributors’ feeds collectively and present them transparently and chronologically, providing a logical, horizontal view of all of the information collected.

fbTREX RSS feed is designed to foster the spirit of the GDPR, providing users control over our own information diet, enabling us to escape the filter bubbles Facebook has designated for us.

**CFA**: Pop your bubble!

**SOCMINT**: fbTREX is not a SOCMINT tool. Queries are restricted to concepts represented by Wikipedia entries. This makes it useful for political research, while preventing potential abuse of personal data.

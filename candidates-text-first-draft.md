fbTREX is facilitating research into the impact of the Facebook algorithm on the 2019 EU elections. In recent years, it has become clear that the lack of transparency of the Facebook platform presents acute problems with regard to elections, as issues of data exploitation, media manipulation, and algorithmic censorship continually surface.

While political campaigns tend to view digital platforms as a means to communicate directly with constituents, Facebook exercises its immense and tightly-held control over the flow of information precisely by intermediating between political groups and citizens, deciding for all of us which stories are or are not seen by users.

Facebook’s personalisation algorithms divide the public square by presenting entirely different information environments to each user. Common sources of information and even common realities are falling away as Facebook attempts to deliver to us only a narrow window of content that it predicts we will engage with in a manner that they can monetise. This often creates echo chambers across the political spectrum, an issue which has been blamed for increasing political polarisation.

Facebook influences the way political discourse is perceived and potentially impacts citizens’ democratic decision-making. The secrecy around personalisation algorithms prevents an understanding of the complexity of public discourse and the social impact of personalisation algorithms and advertising. In order to better understand these issues, we need to shine a light into the black box of Facebook’s algorithm—but we can only do so with collaborative participation.

fbTREX provides open technology solutions which produce a structured dataset of evidence useful for research and analysis into the influence of the Facebook algorithm over political discourse. We aim to promote transparency and accountability over this issue during the critical period of the run-up to the 2019 EU elections, when public opinion is being shaped.

We call on political groups, researchers, and data volunteers to join us in a pan-European effort aimed at observing narratives around EU electoral campaigns to better understand how our perceptions of reality are shaped by the Facebook algorithm. We hope that through this process we can continue to develop a collective approach to the personalised experiences, expectations, and realities that Facebook creates for us.

fbTREX has so far produced research over elections and referendums in 14 countries. Among the most enlightening methods has been to quantify the visibility of publishers’ content in news feeds. This is accomplished by recording the news feed content – or information diet – presented to citizens in the run-up to elections.

We need widespread adoption of the fbTREX toolset in order to build up a robust and heterogeneous dataset from which to glean insights. We look forward to collaborating with interdisciplinary parties from various countries so that together we can produce useful contextual overviews and tangible case studies on how FB’s algorithm may have influenced the narratives around and results of EU elections.

Unlike Facebook, fbTREX prioritises the protection of personal data. Access to the full fbTREX dataset is strictly limited to researchers analysing collective phenomena in the public interest. We are asking individuals only to share some of the data that Facebook gives them – the goal is to study social media influence, not the subjects participating. Still, this information can contain a lot of personally identifying information (PII).

fbTREX’s ethical policy imposes the following limits:
1. We observe only news feeds, not individual profiles or pages.
2. We store only posts marked as “public,” not posts that are restricted to friends.
3. Users who install the extension have full control on their data. They can delete all of the data provided at any time.
4. Third-party access to user data is granted by each user on a case-by-case and strictly opt-in basis.
5. Analyses run on the dataset will be strictly aimed at understanding social phenomenons, not individuals.

**Problem**
* FB’s platform lacks transparency
	* It is unclear whether investments into FB campaigning will be effective
	* It is unclear how the FB algorithm’s influence might impact elections
* Intermediation
	* FB’s control over the flow of information represents an immense and tightly-controlled power
	* Algorithmic censorship?
		* The FB algorithm decides which content to privilege and which to disregard
* FB’s dominance over political opinion and news sharing, particularly during elections
	* Voters are susceptible to tailored and targeted campaigning information created by political entities and served up by SM
		* Is this actually a problem from the perspective of a campaign itself? Reword/consider. Lack of/alteration of headings might make the point being made here more clear.
	* FB claims they are provide a scaled-up public square, yet they in fact divide the public sphere on an individual level
	* FB’s control over public discourse brings corporate responsibilities that they are eschewing
	* FB’s focus on serving up “relevant” political content could promote political echo chambers across the political spectrum
	* FB influences the way political discourse is perceived, potentially creating biases towards sources and impacting how democracy works
* Lack of regulatory authority over digital campaigning, so far

**Vision**
* To provide an open technology solution and structured dataset of evidence to be utilized in research and analysis of the influence and function of the FB algorithm over political discourse surrounding election
	* To promote transparency and accountability for political discourse influence during critical moments when public opinion is being shaped
	* To foster a pan-European effort aimed at observing narratives around EU electoral campaigns
	* To observe in order to better understand how our perceptions of reality are shaped by the FB algorithm in the context of electoral campaigns
	* To foster a collective approach to personalized experiences
* To clarify how the FB business model is leading to the distortion of our time (chronological?), expectations and perceptions of reality
* To promote a better understanding of whether the issues that arise with algorithmic personalization can be adequately addressed by regulatory authorities
* To encourage FB to live up to their supposed mission of “giving people the power to build community and bring the world closer together”
* To better understand how personal data are used in digitally-savvy political campaigns
	* And whether they are actually effective (?)
	* To promote transparency of platforms’ curation practices, in particular as they affect digital political campaigning
* To enable researchers to quantify the visibility of publishers’ content in news feeds

**Solution**
* 14 studies so far on elections or referendums (countries in notes)
* Record the political information diets provided by FB to citizens in the run-up to the elections
	* We need widespread citizen participation, in order to build up a robust and heterogenous dataset
* Interdisciplinary collaboration in various countries
	* To produce useful contextual overviews and tangible case studies of data used by political campaigns
	* To clarify how FB’s algorithm may have influenced the narratives around and results of EU elections

**CTA**
* In development
	* Keywords/concepts
		* Democratization/political discourse
		* Reclaim the public square
* The secrecy around personalization algorithms prevent an understanding of the complexity of public discourse, media manipulation, and the impact of advertising on our perceptions, sentiments, and decisions. In order to better understand these issues, we need to shine a light into the black box of FB’s algorithm—but we can only do so with collaborative participation by political groups, researchers, and data volunteers.

**Limitations**
* Full dataset access is limited to researchers analyzing collective phenomena in the public interest
	* Only timelines
	* Only public posts
	* User has full control over data
	* Third-party access granted by each user in each use case
	* Analysis must aim at understanding social phenomena, not individuals
